Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ivan Yau, a Software Engineer working in Toronto who's head over heels for coding. Right now, I'm diving into Golang and Neovim, while also rocking it with Ruby on Rails.

Guess what? My sights are set on Silicon Valley â€“ I'm packing my ambitions and hopping on a plane to tech paradise! ðŸ›«

My life equation is simple: code + learn + sport. Whether I'm cracking code, picking up new skills, or hitting the sports field, I'm living it to the max.

Catch you later, digital world! I'm turning my dreams into code and my code into reality. ðŸš€ðŸ’»
